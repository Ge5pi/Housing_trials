# Housing Price Prediction

## Overview
This project uses the Ames Housing dataset to predict house prices based on various features. The dataset includes detailed information about houses, such as their size, quality, and location. The script preprocesses the data, selects important features, and trains machine learning models to predict the target variable, `SalePrice`.

## Files
- **data_description.txt**: Provides detailed descriptions of all the features in the dataset.
- **train.csv**: The dataset used for training and testing the models.
- **main.py**: The main Python script that preprocesses the data, trains models, and evaluates their performance.
- **notes.py**: External notes and attempts.

## Features Used
The script uses a combination of numerical and categorical features, including:
- `MSSubClass`: Type of dwelling involved in the sale.
- `MSZoning`: General zoning classification of the sale.
- `LotFrontage`: Linear feet of street connected to the property.
- `OverallQual`: Rates the overall material and finish of the house.
- `YearBuilt`: Original construction date.
- `GrLivArea`: Above grade (ground) living area square feet.
- And many more (see `main.py` for the full list).

## Output
The script outputs the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for each model, allowing you to compare their performance. For example:
- Random Forest Regressor MAE: 22816
- Random Forest Classifier MAE: 28229

## Notes
- The dataset is preprocessed using one-hot encoding for categorical variables and missing values are dropped.
- Logistic Regression and classification models are included for demonstration but are not ideal for predicting continuous variables like house prices.
- The Random Forest Regressor typically provides the best performance for this dataset.

## Acknowledgments
- The Ames Housing dataset is publicly available and widely used for regression tasks.
- Special thanks to the creators of the dataset and the machine learning community for their contributions.


## Future Improvements
🚀 **Hyperparameter Tuning** - Optimize tree depth, number of estimators, etc.

📊 **Feature Engineering** - Include more relevant features to improve accuracy.

🧹 **Handling Missing Data** - Implement better strategies instead of dropping values.

⚡ **Deep Learning Models** - Experiment with neural networks for price prediction.

| Model | MAE |
|--------|------|
| **Logistic Regression** | Varies (Depends on Convergence) |
| **Decision Tree Classifier** | Higher Error (Not Ideal for Regression) |
| **Decision Tree Regressor** | Good Performance |
| **Random Forest Regressor** | **Best Performance (~22,816)** |
| **Random Forest Classifier** | High Error (~28,229) |
